
In Tkinter, when you assign a function to a widget's command option, you provide a reference to the function without parentheses. If you include parentheses, the function will execute immediately during the widget's creation, which is not the intended behavior.

thats why we can lamba function to pass arguments to the function. Here is an example:
command=lambda: greet("Alice")
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
